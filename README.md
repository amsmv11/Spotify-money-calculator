## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.13** or higher
- **uv** package manager ([installation guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv))
- **Spotify Developer Account** - Create one at [developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com/)

- **Docker & Docker Compose** (optional, for containerized deployment)

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify_money_calculator.git
   cd spotify_money_calculator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root (see `.env.example` for reference):
   ```env
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
   SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri
   SPOTIFY_STATE=your_random_state_string
   SPOTIFY_SCOPE=user-library-read
   DISCOGS_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_discogs_personal_access_token
   REDIS_HOST=localhost
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Spotify API Setup

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new application
3. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. Add your redirect URI to the app settings (e.g., `http://localhost:8888/api/v0/spotify/callback`)
5. Make sure to request the `user-library-read` scope to access saved albums

### Discogs API Setup

1. Go to [Discogs Developer Settings](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers)
2. Generate a **Personal Access Token**
3. Copy the token to your `.env` file as `DISCOGS_ACCESS_TOKEN`
4. This token allows the app to search for album prices in the Discogs marketplace

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` | Your Spotify app client ID | Yes | - |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Your Spotify app client secret | Yes | - |
| `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` | OAuth callback URL | Yes | - |
| `SPOTIFY_STATE` | Random string for OAuth state verification | Yes | - |
| `SPOTIFY_SCOPE` | Spotify API scopes (e.g., `user-library-read`) | Yes | - |
| `DISCOGS_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Your Discogs personal access token | Yes | - |
| `REDIS_HOST` | Redis server hostname | No | `localhost` |
| `REDIS_PORT` | Redis server port | No | `6379` |

## 🎮 Usage

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)
Start the application with Redis using Docker:
```bash
make up
```

Stop the services:
```bash
make stop
```

Clean up containers and volumes:
```bash
make clean
```

#### Option 2: Local Development
Start the development server (requires Redis running locally):
```bash
make run
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8888`

### API Endpoints

#### Home Page
```
GET /api/v0/spotify/
```
Returns the home page. If authenticated, shows user's albums and prices. Otherwise, shows landing page.

#### Initiate Spotify Login
```
GET /api/v0/spotify/login
```
Redirects to Spotify's OAuth authorization page. Users will be asked to grant permissions to access their Spotify data.

#### OAuth Callback
```
GET /api/v0/spotify/callback?code={code}&state={state}
```
Handles the OAuth callback from Spotify. Exchanges the authorization code for an access token and sets secure cookies.

**Response**: Returns success page and sets httponly cookies for session management.

#### Get User's Saved Albums
```
GET /api/v0/spotify/user_albums?limit={limit}
```
Retrieves the authenticated user's saved albums from Spotify.

**Parameters**:
- `limit` (int): Number of albums to fetch. Use `-1` to fetch all albums with pagination.

**Response**: JSON array of album objects with metadata (name, artist, release date, artwork, etc.)

#### Calculate Album Prices
```
POST /api/v0/spotify/get_albums_price
```
Calculates the cost of purchasing albums physically based on Discogs marketplace data.

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "albums": [
    {
      "artist": "Artist Name",
      "album_name": "Album Title"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "albums_with_price": [
    {
      "artist": "Artist Name",
      "album_name": "Album Title",
      "price": 12.50,
      "valid": true
    }
  ],
  "total": 12.50,
  "currency": "EUR"
}
```

#### Get All Albums with Prices
```
GET /api/v0/spotify/all_albums_price
```
Retrieves all authenticated user's saved albums with calculated prices.

**Response**: Same format as the POST endpoint above, but includes all user's albums.

#### Real-time Price Calculation (WebSocket)
```
WS /api/v0/spotify/ws/calculate_all_albums
```
Establishes a WebSocket connection for real-time streaming of album price calculations. This endpoint processes albums one by one and sends progress updates.

**Message Types**:
- `total`: Initial message with total album count
- `album`: Individual album with calculated price and metadata
- `complete`: Calculation finished
- `error`: Error occurred during processing

**Example Album Message**:
```json
{
  "type": "album",
  "index": 1,
  "total": 150,
  "album": {
    "name": "Album Title",
    "artist": "Artist Name",
    "price": 12.50,
    "valid": true,
    "image": "https://...",
    "release_date": "2023-01-01"
  }
}
```

### Example Flow

1. Start the server: `make run`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8888/api/v0/spotify/`
3. Click the login button to authorize with Spotify
4. Grant permissions to access your library
5. Get redirected to the home page showing your albums
6. View your album collection with images and calculated CD prices
7. See the total cost of your collection in EUR

## 🔧 Development

### Available Commands

The project uses a Makefile for common development tasks:

```bash
# Docker commands
make up         # Start application with Docker Compose
make stop       # Stop Docker Compose services
make clean      # Remove containers, volumes, and images

# Development commands
make run        # Run the application locally with UV
make format     # Format code with ruff
make lint       # Run linter with auto-fix
make check-lint # Check linting without fixes
make check      # Format + lint check
make help       # Show all available commands
```

### Code Style

This project uses [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for both formatting and linting:
- **Formatting**: Consistent code style across the project
- **Linting**: Catch common errors and enforce best practices

Run `make check` before committing to ensure code quality.
